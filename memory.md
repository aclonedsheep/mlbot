## 2026-05-31 - Iteration 1: Initial Scaffold

- Goal: implement a Dockerized Python async IRC bot for a single MLB channel.
- Decisions: use direct MLB Stats API calls, `ircrobots`, `httpx`, `pydantic-settings`, `aiosqlite`, SQLite state, and command prefix `@`.
- Scope locked: no per-team alert toggles; alerts are channel-wide and controlled by env/config.
- Git: created branch `codex/mlb-irc-bot` from the unborn repository.
- Files: adding project scaffold, package layout, Docker config, docs, and test directories.
- Verification: pending after scaffold commit.
